// Every program must have a Main class to run.
class Main {
    fun __init__ self *args **kwargs {

        !print 'The following keyword is the "while" keyword:';
        // This shortened if statement works, but only if it has ONE line after it:
        if 0 < 10 :: !print 'YES';
        // This while loop format works as well, and it can have multiple lines after it:
        $int a = 0;
        while a < 4 {
            !print 'bam';
            $str i = !input;
            $int a += 1;
        }
        // If you want to make your code fancy, you can use the multi-line format for one line:
        if a == 4 {
            !print 'a is equal to 4';
        }
    }
}
